🧩 How It Works (Logic Breakdown)
➤ Adding a Task

The user enters text

Clicks Add

A new <li> with the task name + delete button is created

➤ Completing a Task

Clicking a task toggles .completed class

Adds a line-through effect

➤ Deleting a Task

Clicking the X button removes the task from the list

addEventListener() for handling button clicks

DOM manipulation: createElement, appendChild, remove()
